# hello-world
My learning repository

Greetings my fellow coders,
Shawn here, I came here to learn how to use GitHub and to expand my Java knowledge beyond your comprehension.
I know that statement might sound a bit arrogant and over ambitious for someone who only now learning to use GitHub but never underestimate the power of the mind and determination.

Code-on!
